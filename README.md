# Bank-Customer-Churn-Modelling

## Aim:
#### A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10,000 records dataset to investigate and predict which of the customers are more     likely to leave the bank soon.

### Libraries/ tools used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Tensorflow.Keras
6. Jupyter Notebook

### Description:
1. The Dataset is taken from Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling
2. EDA is performed on the dataset to get meaning ful insights about the customers of the bank.
3. This problem is solved by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the combinations of different optimizers and found out that the deeper architecture with no    dropout.
4. The ANN Model predicts an accuracy of 86.37 with improved Training loss and Training Accuracy scores.
